# Getting Started

The system is using h2 in memory database.

The system only contain one get and one post method.

When build is run, it build the app.jar into the build/libs directory.

It is using JPA(CRUD Repository Interface) and serves on 8888 port.

For inserting some data, I implemented ApplicationRunner interface
